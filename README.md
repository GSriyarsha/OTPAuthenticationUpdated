# OTPAuthenticationUpdated
An Android Application for easy maintenance of the traffic rules and penalties given in a quick and easier manner so that everyone gets the sense of responsibility to abide by the rules.
About project:
Name of the project: Rider Catcher
Technologies Used: Android Studios, Google Vision API, Optical Character Recognition, Fire Base Database
Objective of the project: To reduce the traffic violation cases by capturing their images, authenticating them and then setting up a fine (challan) for them.
Description: The vehicle number in the image and the number entered by the user must be matched. Number plate recognition has two major parts:
•	Vehicle number plate extraction,
•	Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
Number plate extraction is that stage where vehicle number plate is detected and extract the number plate text. The segmented characters are normalized and passed to an OCR algorithm. At last the optical character information will be converted into encoded text. The characters are recognized using Template matching. The final output must be in the form of string of characters.
The person uploading the violations will be given reward points, which can be used at any government owned shop. The image Recognition is taken through the concepts of Optical Character Recognition as it identifies the apt image of a person and his violation is detected and a fine(challan) is issued for him.
End Learning : To learn the concepts of Android application UI / UX to build an effective application with the concepts of Optical Character Recognition for image recognition for  identification of the vehicle number and image of the violator.
Maintaining two database : one for storing the user information in the database and other to store the information about the traffic offender. The fine information about the Traffic Offenders would be periodically sent to the Traffic Department for subsequent action to be taken.
